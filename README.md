# Petit compiler compiler

## Project scope.

this project aims to learn how to implement yacc like tools. but LR(0) class syntax only.

## current status.

* generating canonical automaton.
* generating LR(0) parsing table.
* interpret LR(0) parsing table.
* export LR(0) parsing table as LaTeX source.
* export step by step parsing as LaTeX source.
* export canonical automaton as graphviz source.

## future work.

* generate rust source.
* yacc like syntax input.
